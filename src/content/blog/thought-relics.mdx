As a bright bird comes flying From airy extravagance to his own home, And breasts his mate, and feels her all his goal, So from boon sunlight and the fresh chill wave Which swirled and lapped between the slumbering fields, From forest pools and wanderings mid leaves Through emerald ever-new discoveries, Mysterious hillsides ranged and buoyant-swift Races with our wild brothers in the meads, Came Ruru back to the white-bosomed girl, Strong-winged to pleasure."

IN woodlands of the bright and early world, When love was to himself yet new and warm And stainless, played like morning with a flower Ruru with his young bride Priyumvada. Fresh-cheeked and dew-eyed white Priyumvada Opened her budded heart of crimson bloom To love, to Ruru; Ruru, a happy flood Of passion round a lotus dancing thrilled, Blinded with his soul's waves Priyumvada. To him the earth was a bed for this sole flower, To her all the world was filled with his embrace. Wet with new rains the morning earth, released From her fierce centuries and burning suns, Lavished her breath in greenness; poignant flowers Thronged all her eager breast, and her young arms Cradled a childlike bounding life that played And would not cease, nor ever weary grew Of her bright promise; for all was joy and breeze And perfume, colour and bloom and ardent rays Of living, and delight desired the world. Then Earth was quick and pregnant tamelessly; A free and unwalled race possessed her plains Whose hearts uncramped by bonds, whose unspoiled thoughts At once replied to light. Foisoned (sic) the fields; Lonely and rich the forests and the swaying Of those unnumbered tops affected men With thoughts to their vast music kin. Undammed The virgin rivers moved towards the sea, And mountains yet unseen and peoples vague Winged young imagination like an eagle To strange beauty remote. And Ruru felt The sweetness of the early earth as sap All through him, and short life an aeon made

By boundless possibility, and love, Sweetest of all unfathomable love, A glory untired. As a bright bird comes flying From airy extravagance to his own home, And breasts his mate, and feels her all his goal, So from boon sunlight and the fresh chill wave Which swirled and lapped between the slumbering fields, From forest pools and wanderings mid leaves Through emerald ever-new discoveries, Mysterious hillsides ranged and buoyant-swift Races with our wild brothers in the meads, Came Ruru back to the white-bosomed girl, Strong-winged to pleasure. She all fresh and new Rose to him, and he plunged into her charm. For neither to her honey and poignancy Artlessly interchanged, nor any limit To the sweet physical delight of her He found. Her eyes like deep and infinite wells Lured his attracted soul, and her touch thrilled Not lightly, though so light; the joy prolonged And sweetness of the lingering of her lips Was every time a nectar of surprise To her lover; her smooth-gleaming shoulder bared In darkness of her hair showed jasmine-bright, While her kissed bosom by rich tumults stirred Was a moved sea that rocked beneath his heart, Then when her lips had made him blind, soft siege Of all her unseen body to his rule Betrayed the ravishing realm of her white limbs, An empire for the glory of a God. He knew not whether he loved most her smile, Her causeless tears or little angers swift, Whether held wet against him from the bath Among her kindred lotuses, her cheeks Soft to his lips and dangerous happy breasts That vanquished all his strength with their desire, Meeting his absence with her sudden face, Or when the leaf-hid bird at night complained Near their wreathed arbour on the moonlit lake, Sobbing delight out from her heart of bliss,

Or in his clasp of rapture laughing low Of his close bosom bridal-glad and pleased With passion and this fiery play of love, Or breaking off like one who thinks of grief, Wonderful melancholy in her eyes Grown liquid and with wayward sorrow large, Thus he in her found a warm world of sweets, And lived of ecstasy secure, nor deemed Any new hour could match that early bliss. But Love has joys for spirits born divine More bleeding-lovely than his thornless rose. That day he had left, while yet the east was dark, Rising, her bosom and into the river Swam out, exulting in the sting and swift Sharp-edged desire around his limbs, and sprang Wet to the bank, and streamed into the wood. As a young horse upon the pastures glad Feels greensward and the wind along his mane And arches as he goes his neck, so went In an immense delight of youth the boy And shook his locks, joy-crested. Boundlessly He revelled in swift air of life, a creature Of wide and vigorous morning. Far he strayed Tempting for flower and fruit branches in heaven, And plucked, and flung away, and brighter chose, Seeking comparisons for her bloom; and followed New streams, and touched new trees, and felt slow beauty And leafy secret change; for the damp leaves, Grey-green at first, grew pallid with the light And warmed with consciousness of sunshine near; Then the whole daylight wandered in, and made Hard tracts of splendour, and enriched all hues. But when a happy sheltered heat he felt And heard contented voice of living things Harmonious with the noon, he turned and swiftly Went homeward yearning to Priyumvada, And near his home emerging from green leaves He laughed towards the sun: "O father Sun," He cried, "how good it is to live, to love! Surely our joy shall never end, nor we

Grow old, but like bright rivers or pure winds Sweetly continue, or revive with flowers, Or live at least as long as senseless trees." He dreamed, and said with a soft smile: "Lo, she! And she will turn from me with angry tears Her delicate face more beautiful than storm Or rainy moonlight. I will follow her, And soothe her heart with sovereign flatteries; Or rather all tyranny exhaust and taste The beauty of her anger like a fruit, Vexing her soul with helplessness; then soften Easily with quiet undenied demand Of heart insisting upon heart; or else Will reinvest her beauty bright with flowers, Or with my hands her little feet persuade. Then will her face be like a sudden dawn, And flower compelled into reluctant smiles." He had not ceased when he beheld her. She, Tearing a jasmine bloom with waiting hands, Stood drooping, petulant, but heard at once His footsteps and before she was aware, A sudden smile of exquisite delight Leaped to her mouth, and a great blush of joy Surprised her cheeks. She for a moment stood Beautiful with her love before she died; And he laughed towards her. With a pitiful cry She paled; moaning, her stricken limbs collapsed. But petrified, in awful dumb surprise, He gazed; then waking with a bound was by her, All panic expectation. As he came, He saw a brilliant flash of coils evade The sunlight, and with hateful gorgeous hood Darted into green safety, hissing, death. Voiceless he sank beside her and stretched out His arms and desperately touched her face, As if to attract her soul to live, and sought Beseeching with his hands her bosom. O, she Was warm, and cruel hope pierced him; but pale As jasmines fading on a girl's sweet breast Her cheek was, and forgot its perfect rose.
